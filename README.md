I currently use Gitlab for free on SaaS, I will soon switch to Self Hosting and all Files won't be `.zip` Files, but for some Reason you cant upload a Folder directly on Gitlab web and Kraken doesnt work.
Don't help me with that, I'll switch to self hosting anyways and I can just put the Files up there directly!
